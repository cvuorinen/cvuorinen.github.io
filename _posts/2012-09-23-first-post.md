So, this is the first post in my blog. I have been thinking about starting a blog for a long time and over the years I have had some great ideas for blog posts (which I have now forgotten all about), but never actually got around to actually start blogging. Mainly using the excuse "I just don't have the time" to myself.

Currently I am working on a couple of posts related to unit testing a Zend Framework 1 application. And by mentioning them here I will hopefully have the motivation to actually complete them and post them.

I have been doing web development for almost 10 years now and mostly with PHP. I have been working most of that time at a Finnish software development company [W3 Group](http://w3.fi) (previously W-Create) where I am currently a partner and work as a team leader/lead developer. You can read more about me in the [about page](/about/) or contact me through the [contact page](/contact/).

So, here goes. I have started a blog. My expectations are not that high regarding post frequency (I have two small children that occupy most of my spare time) and certainly not regarding visitor numbers. But hopefully I will manage to keep this alive and post something every now and again. My main motivation behind starting this blog is that I want to improve my writing skills and also to have someplace to post random development notes for later reference. Thanks for reading and please post a comment if you find anything that you like (or don't like).
