I decided to take the advice [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/) gave to a commenter who asked for advice on blog post ideas on a [recent Lifehacker interview](http://lifehacker.com/5950386/im-jeff-atwood-founder-of-stack-exchange-and-this-is-how-i-work).

After I decided to start a blog I first needed to decide what software or service I was going to use. Blogger and other similar services are easy to get started with, but since I am a developer I like to have more control over a site I'm running. I already had some WordPress experience so the decision was quite easy after all.

Next thing I started thinking about was the theme. I have always liked a minimal design so I can do most of the work in a text editor rather than Photoshop or similar image editor. The WordPress default theme (twenty eleven at the time) was a good starting point. It is mostly black and white, it has a clean and minimalist look and it's responsive, which is also something I wanted to get more experience with. I started out by creating a child theme and gathering some ideas. Since I am not that creative visually, my design process is mostly combining and tweaking ideas and concepts I like from other sites I have seen and using them to a create a design I like and that I can call my own.

Here are some of the things I customized from the default theme: search in menu bar, meta fields on the left, round RSS, Twitter &amp; LinkedIn buttons in header, use [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) for icons, use custom fonts from [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts) and also numerous small tweaks and style changes.

The source code for this theme is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/cvuorinen/cvuorinen-wp-theme), so you can fork it if you like it. I would appreciate a comment or email if you decide to use it.

The design is not by any means final, I already have lots of ideas for small improvements. If only I had the time to implement them all. Currently it is good enough that I can live with it. Feel free to share your thoughts about it in the comments.
