Hi! I am Carl Vuorinen and this is my blog. I am a web developer with about 10 years of experience in web development and PHP is my language of choice. I have worked most of that time in a Finnish software development company [W3 Group](http://w3.fi) where I am currently a partner and work as a team lead. Lately I have been working mostly with Symfony2 and before that with Zend Framework, Drupal and various other frameworks, CMS's, eCommerce solutions and plain PHP stuff. I live in Järvenpää, Finland with my wife and two beautiful daughters.

My main motivation behind starting this blog is that I want to improve my writing skills and also to have someplace to post random web development related notes for later reference. Thanks for reading and please post a comment if you find anything that you like (or don't like).
