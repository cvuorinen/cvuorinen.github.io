Hi! I am Carl Vuorinen and this is my blog. I am a web developer with over a decade of experience in web development, mostly using PHP, JavaScript and TypeScript. I have worked most of that time in a Finnish software development company [City Dev Labs](https://citydevlabs.fi/) (formerly W3 Group Finland) where I am currently a partner and work as a team lead. Lately I have been working mostly with Symfony, Express, Angular and React but before that with various other frameworks, CMS's, eCommerce solutions and plain PHP & JS stuff. I live in Järvenpää, Finland with my wife and two beautiful daughters (who are also [learning how to code](https://ifgirlthencode.blogspot.fi/)).

My main motivation behind starting this blog is that I want to improve my writing skills and also to have someplace to post random web development related notes for later reference. Thanks for reading and please post a comment if you find anything that you like (or don't like).
